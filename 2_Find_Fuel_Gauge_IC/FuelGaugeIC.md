# Fuel Gauge IC: 
A fuel gauge IC is a type of electronic device that is used to measure and monitor the state of charge of a battery. It is often used in portable electronic devices such as smartphones, laptops, and tablets to provide accurate information about the battery level and remaining battery life to the user.The accurate measurement and monitoring of battery state of charge is critical in ensuring the proper functioning and long-term reliability of electronic devices. Fuel gauge ICs play an important role in achieving this by providing accurate and reliable information about the battery level and remaining battery life to the user.

# How it works:
Fuel gauge ICs work by measuring and analyzing the battery's electrical parameters to estimate the state of charge (SOC) and state of health (SOH) of the battery. The basic working principle of a fuel gauge IC involves measuring the voltage, current, and temperature of the battery and using this data to estimate the SOC and SOH.</br>

Two common techniques used in fuel gauge ICs are Coulomb counting and Model-based estimation.
1. Coulomb counting: This estimates the state-of-charge (SOC) of the battery by measuring the amount of charge that enters and leaves the battery.</br>

2. Model-based estimation: This uses a mathematical model of the battery's behavior to estimate the SOC based on various inputs such as voltage, current, temperature, and other battery parameters.</br>

# Choosing IC
Above comparison gives us a good idea about different Fuel Gauge ICs available in the market. From above comparison we can clearly see that first 3 options(BQ27427YZFR, BQ27Z746YAHR and STC3117IJT) are most desirable based on their size, price and features compare to other ICs. Now we can narrow down further based on our requirements specifically for smartwatch application.</br>

1. Battery Types:</br>
    * BQ27Z746YAHR support Li-Ion/Li-Polymer and Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries, while the STC3117IJT and BQ27427YZFR only supports Li-ion/Li-polymer batteries.
2. SOC/SOH Algorithm:</br>
    * All three ICs uses patented algorithms for accurate battery capacity calculation.
    * BQ27Z746YAHR and BQ27427YZFR uses Impedance Track™ Technology [(Detailed Document)](Docs/ImpedanceTrackAlgorithm.pdf)
    * STC3117IJT OptimGauge™ Algorithm [(ST Blog)](https://blog.st.com/stc3117-battery-fuel-gauge-optimgauge/)
3. Communication Interface:</br>
    * All three ICs support I2C communication interface, but the BQ27Z746YAHR also support HDQ and SMBus interfaces.
4. Standby Current:</br>
    * The BQ27427YZFR and STC3117IJT have very low standby currents of 9µA and 2µA, respectively. The BQ27Z746YAHR has a standby current of 0.2µA, which is significantly lower than the other two ICs.
5. Size:
    * The BQ27427YZFR and STC3117IJT have very small package sizes of 1.62mm x 1.58mm x 0.5mm and 1.49mm x 1.594mm x 0.4 mm.
 , respectively, which makes them suitable for compact devices such as smartwatches. The BQ27Z746YAHR has a slightly larger package size of 2.6mm x 1.7mm x 0.4mm.

# Impedance Track™ Technology vs OptimGauge™ algorithm
* Impedance Track™ technology is a patented algorithm used in fuel gauge ICs that accurately measures battery capacity by analyzing the battery's internal impedance. It measures the changes in impedance that occur as the battery charges and discharges, and uses this data to calculate the state of charge and the remaining capacity of the battery.</br>
* OptimGauge™ algorithm is a patented battery fuel gauging technology developed by STMicroelectronics. It uses advanced modeling and filtering techniques to accurately calculate the state of charge (SOC) and state of health (SOH) of the battery in real-time, based on the battery's voltage, current, and temperature measurements.
* Both Algorithm provides good accuracy when it comes to SOC/SOH measurements from initial study. Although thorough study required to choose one over other.
